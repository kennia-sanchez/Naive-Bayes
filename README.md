We will explore the application of the Naive Bayes classification algorithm to classify data into two different classes. We will use a dataset that contains two input dimensions (x1 and x2) and the class to which each entry belongs. Our goal is to train a Naive Bayes model using the training data, and then classify new instances using this model.
